**Description**:

I made this project for learning D3D11 and implementing some graphic techniques, using variety of resources such as Frank Luna's [Introduction to 3D Game Programming With DirectX 11](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-3D-Game-Programming-DirectX11/dp/1936420228), [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/directx), [3DGep](https://www.3dgep.com/), .... and Google in general.
No deprecated/legacy frameworks like Effects11 are used, I have kept the code up to date with current standards.
