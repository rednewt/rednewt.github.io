# Domino Castle

<i class="fa fa-github" style="font-size:48px"></i> 

**Description**: This game was our entry for the 'Week of Awesome' game jam event at [gamedev.net](https://www.gamedev.net/). The game is about falling as many towers as possible, which are made up of dominos (Toys, not pizza). You jump from one domino to other and try to  start a chain reaction to make towers fall down.
