**Description**: This game was our entry for the 'Week of Awesome' game jam event at [gamedev.net](https://www.gamedev.net/). The game is about falling as many towers as possible, which are made up of dominos. You jump from one domino to other and try to start a chain reaction to make towers fall.

**Technologies used**: UE4 (Blueprints), Blender

Here is a YouTube video of a judge (of the game jam event) playing on the second level on hard mode. As the game was made in one week, it was buggy as expected, so even though the judge is playing on hard mode, the game still displays it as 'Easy' in some of the menus.
