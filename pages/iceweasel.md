**Description**: 

This project started as an ambitious gravity-based shooter using Unreal Engine 4, but the development stopped due to a lack of resources. Nevertheless, it is still a good showcase of the networking work I have done in this project. It also helped me brush up on my UE4 knowledge. Most importantly, I learned how to use C++ and blueprints together and strike a balance between efficiency and ease of use.

**Things I worked on**:
* Server browser
* Quick match feature
* Multiplayer chat
* Scoreboard
* Team spawns
* Character input and its Animation Blueprint
* Replicating aimoffsets over network
* Replicating input/character state variables over network
* Steam integration
* Main menu
